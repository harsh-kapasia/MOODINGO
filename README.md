# Moodingo – AI-Powered Mood Analysis App

*A smart and intuitive tool for real-time mood detection and emotional insights.*

---

## 🧠 About the Project

**Moodingo** is an AI-powered mood analysis application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to detect and analyze human emotions from text. Whether you're writing a journal, chatting, or submitting any form of text, Moodingo intelligently identifies emotional tones like **joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, **fear**, **surprise**, and **neutrality**.

Designed to be **accurate**, **interactive**, and **privacy-focused**, Moodingo provides:

- 💬 Real-time Mood Detection  
- 📈 Mood Tracking and Analytics  
- 📊 Visualizations (charts, timelines, emotion trends)  
- 🎯 Daily Insights and Reports  
- 🔒 Privacy-first Architecture  
- 🧼 Clean and Minimalistic UI

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js (bootstrapped with `create-next-app`)
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js or Recharts

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Python (for ML model server, optional via Flask/FastAPI)
- Next.js API routes (`pages/api`)

**AI/ML & NLP:**

## 📦 Getting Started

This is a **Next.js project** bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.


🧠 ML Model Training
The emotion detection model is trained on datasets such as:

Emotion Dataset by CrowdFlower

ISEAR Dataset

Preprocessed using NLP techniques and trained using Scikit-learn classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest.

Optional: You can integrate a Python backend to serve the model using Flask or FastAPI and call it from your Next.js API routes.

🔐 Deployment
Deploying on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js frontend is via Vercel (from the creators of Next.js):

Push your repo to GitHub

Go to vercel.com

Import your GitHub repo

Set environment variables (if any)

Deploy 🎉

If you're using a separate ML model backend (e.g., Flask API), deploy it via Render or Heroku and connect it via API calls.

🧪 API Example
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/predict	Returns mood prediction


📌 Future Enhancements
📱 Mobile version (React Native)

🧠 BERT/Transformer-based NLP model integration

🧘 Mood-based suggestions (music, quotes, exercises)

📥 File upload (diary or journal entries)

🗣️ Voice-to-text emotion analysis
